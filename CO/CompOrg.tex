\section{Architecture vs Organisation}

\textbf{Computer architecture} is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality
organization, and implementation of computer systems. Some definitions of architecture 
define it as describing the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a 
particular implementation.\\

\textbf{Microarchitecture}, also called \textbf{computer organization} and sometimes abbreviated
 as Âµarch or uarch, is the way a given instruction set architecture is implemented in a particular 
 processor.
